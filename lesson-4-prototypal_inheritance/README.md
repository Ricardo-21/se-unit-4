# Unit 4 Lesson 4: Prototypal Inheritance

## Key Terms
* inheritance
* prototypal delegation
* prototype object
* instance

## Key Properties/Methods
* `Object.create`
* `Function.prototype.prototype`
* `Object.prototype`
* `Object.prototype.constructor`
* `Object.assign`

## Essential Questions
* How does JavaScript's prototypal delegation model differ from inheritance in traditional object-oriented language?
* Using the pseudo-classical pattern, how do we create a constructor that instantiates objects that inherit from a different prototype?
* What is a _mixin_ and when would create a mixin relationship instead of inheritance?
